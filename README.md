# MinerDropper

A trojan horse that drops a portable runtime of MinerGate's CLI CPU cryptocurrency miner. Includes basic persistance.

# Why

Idk, it occurs to anyone who ends up mining. It's just a thought experiment ;) 

# Notes

It gets flagged by Windows Defender every step of the way. No serious attempt at obfuscation though it would be really easy...
plenty of literature on the subject.

That being said, once it's running, you'll never notice it. Nothing will seem to have happened at all. Easy to get rid of however.
